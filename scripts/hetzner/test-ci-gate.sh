# Tests for the CI gate's verdict — the rule that decides whether a commit is
# allowed to reach production.
#
# This rule had been wrong three times before it had a single test, and each
# bug was found the same way: a real deploy blocked, a human digging through
# Actions logs to learn that the gate had misread them.
#
#   1. Dependabot's updater run counted as CI, so solon and reparaturbonus-zh
#      could not deploy commits whose `verify` was green.
#   2. The deploy workflow counted itself, so a retry after a failed deploy
#      read its own earlier failure as a red and could never succeed.
#   3. A cancelled run outvoted the green RE-RUN that replaced it on the same
#      SHA, so printcraft's storage-security fix sat undeployed while `verify`
#      passed.
#
# All three are cases where the gate said RED about code that was fine. That is
# the dangerous direction for a gate to be wrong in, because the only way past
# a gate that will not open is to disable it. So each is pinned here.
#
# The opposite direction is pinned too: every "must block" case below exists so
# a future simplification cannot make the gate permissive to buy convenience.
