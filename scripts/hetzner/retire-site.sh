# Take a site down — off the public internet, behind a password, or gone.
#
# new-site.sh creates seven things: a GitHub repository, a row in apps.conf
# (which allocates a port), a checkout on the box, /opt/<slug> (app, releases,
# shared/.env, uploads), a systemd unit, a Caddy vhost, and a monitoring
# target. Until this script existed, the product could create all seven and
# undo exactly one of them — the repository — so "delete the project" left a
# site serving to the whole internet on a wildcard DNS record, with a
# certificate, and a port nobody could reclaim.
#
# The Caddy vhost is the public switch. Wildcard DNS (*.orangecat.ch) points
# every name at this box, so a site is reachable if and only if a server block
# claims its host: remove /etc/caddy/apps.d/<slug>.caddy and the name stops
# resolving to anything servable, immediately, without touching the app.
#
# MODES, least to most destructive:
#   offline   stop the app, remove the vhost. Everything else kept. Reversible
#             with --mode restore. This is the honest answer to "make it not
#             public" — nothing is destroyed, and it takes effect at once.
#   private   keep it serving, behind HTTP basic auth, and make the repository
#             private. For showing a client work in progress.
#   restore   the inverse of offline/private: regenerate unit + vhost from
#             apps.conf and start the app again.
#   delete    everything on the box: unit, vhost, /opt/<slug>, the checkout,
#             the apps.conf row (which frees the port), the monitoring target.
#             The repository is handled separately (--repo), because deleting a
#             repository is the one step nobody can undo.
#
# A PLAN IS PRINTED AND NOTHING HAPPENS unless --go is passed. That is the
# default on purpose: every other script here defaults to doing the thing, and
# every other script here is additive.
#
