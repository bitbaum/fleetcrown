# Install the stranded-work watch: a timer that notices when a cloud dispatch
# left work on the box that nobody can see.
#
# The operating contract (box-agent-claude.md) tells agents to commit, push, and
# open a PR. This is the half that does not depend on an agent following it. The
# failure being caught is silent by construction — the operator never opens this
# filesystem — so without a watch, lost work is discovered only by not existing.
#
# Reuses /opt/monitoring/lib-alert.sh (Telegram + journal, alert_transition fires
# only on a state flip). Detection logic lives in agent-work-check.sh, a real
# file with a real test (test-agent-work-watch.sh) rather than a heredoc — the
# host-alerts payloads had to be re-extracted by their test to be checkable, and
# once burned is enough.
#
# Idempotent: re-run to update the checker or the schedule.
#
# Usage:  bash scripts/hetzner/install-agent-work-watch.sh [user@host]
