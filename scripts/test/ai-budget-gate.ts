/**
 * Inline tests for the AI budget admission gate (lib/ai-budget/gate.ts) and the
 * day-capacity SSOT (config/chat-models.ts).
 *
 * The policy itself is covered by test:fair-share. What this pins is the part
 * that decides whether the product works when the plumbing does not:
 *
 *   - a ledger error must ADMIT the turn, never refuse it. Rationing is a
 *     nicety; a database hiccup turning into "Loki is down" is not a trade
 *     anyone would choose, and the guard-that-reads-state failure mode has
 *     already cost this fleet a day of blocked deploys.
 *   - capacity counts only providers we hold a key for, or users are rationed
 *     against tokens that cannot be reached.
 *   - the two refusals keep their distinct meanings all the way out to the
 *     message the user reads.
 *
 * Run: npm run test:ai-budget-gate
