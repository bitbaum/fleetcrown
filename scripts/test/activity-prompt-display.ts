/**
 * The Activity feed's core promise: show me what I actually asked for.
 *
 * Reported from a phone 2026-08-26 — every dispatch row read
 * "Next best — assembled operator dispatch (brief + goals + autopilot rules;
 * full text hidden)" or, worse, just "custom". The text was never missing:
 * lib/inject-prompt.ts wraps the operator's task in ~2,000 words of preamble,
 * context blocks and an exit contract, and the display layer responded by
 * suppressing the whole envelope instead of unwrapping it.
 *
 * These cases pin the unwrapping against the exact block headers the dispatch
 * pipeline emits. If someone changes a heading upstream without updating
 * ENVELOPE_BLOCK_PATTERNS, the task must still survive (shown with some
 * background noise) — never be swallowed with the background.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/test/activity-prompt-display.ts (or npm run test:unit)
