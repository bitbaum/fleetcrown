/**
 * Every `##` block the dispatch pipeline injects must be strippable by
 * `extractOperatorTask`, so the Activity feed shows what the operator ASKED
 * rather than the scaffolding wrapped around it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * ENVELOPE_BLOCK_PATTERNS in lib/activity-status.ts is a hand-kept list of the
 * headings the pipeline emits, and its own comment predicts the failure: "a
 * block that changes upstream stops matching". It did. The list carried
 *
 *     ## Background context from your other projects
 *
 * while db/queries/knowledge-embeddings.ts emits
 *
 *     ## Relevant context from your other projects (retrieved)
 *
 * Nothing failed. The block simply survived into the preview, so rows on
 * /activity read `asked: ## Relevant context from your other projects…` —
 * retrieval scaffolding presented as the operator's own question, on the one
 * page whose job is to answer "what did I ask for?". Observed on production
 * 2026-09-05 across every row of the "Needs you" list.
 *
 * A second hand-maintained list checking the first would rot the same way, so
 * this DISCOVERS the headings from the pipeline source and tests behaviour: it
 * builds a dispatch around each one and asserts the heading does not survive
 * while the task does.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/test/dispatch-headings-stripped.ts
