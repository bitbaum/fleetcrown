/**
 * What the report is actually told.
 *
 * The generated reports read as vague filler for a structural reason, not a
 * prompt-tuning one: buildUserPrompt fed the model `timeline` PROMPT bodies
 * only. For every assembled dispatch that body was the literal placeholder
 * "…assembled operator dispatch (brief + goals + autopilot rules; full text
 * hidden)", and the model never saw a single run outcome, duration or error.
 * It was summarising a string that said nothing, about work it could not see.
 *
 * These cases pin the input: real asks, real outcomes, real failure causes,
 * failures first.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/test/digest-input.ts (or npm run test:unit)
