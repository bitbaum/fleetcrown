/**
 * A link the register has not checked is a claim it cannot support.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: on 2026-09-11 the /fleet page rendered 37 outbound links.
 * Three were dead — two OrangeCat project pages whose projects had been deleted
 * since the id was recorded, and every Solon chip, which pointed at
 * /orgs/<slug>, a route Solon does not have and never had. The register looked
 * authoritative and was wrong, which is worse than a register that admits a
 * gap.
 *
 * The rule these pin: a 404 is an answer (the thing is gone, drop the link);
 * anything else — a timeout, a 502, a rate limit — is NOT an answer, and must
 * leave the link in place while reporting `checked: false`. Reading an
 * unreachable OrangeCat as "this project has no profile" would quietly delete
 * true facts from the page every time their host had a bad minute.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/test/register-link-probe.ts
