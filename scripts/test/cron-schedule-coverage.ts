/**
 * Every cron ROUTE has a TIMER, and every timer has a route.
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/test/cron-schedule-coverage.ts
 *
 * The class this closes: a cron endpoint can be written, reviewed, merged and
 * deployed while nothing on the box ever calls it. It is invisible because it
 * looks exactly like a working feature — the code is there, the route responds
 * if you curl it, and the only symptom is that the job silently never runs.
 * "Gates cannot see absence": no existing check could notice a job that was
 * never scheduled, because there is nothing to inspect.
 *
 * The discriminator is `requireCronAuth`. A route under api/crons/ that uses it
 * is machine-driven and MUST be on a timer; the session-authed ones (the cron
 * CRUD endpoints a human's browser calls) must NOT be. That is a property of
 * the code rather than a hand-maintained exclusion list, so it cannot rot.
 *
 * The reverse direction matters just as much: a timer naming a route that no
 * longer exists fails every night into a log nobody reads.
