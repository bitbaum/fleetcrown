/**
 * "Zero proposals" has four causes, and they need four different fixes.
 *
 * The frontier loop surfaced nothing from 2026-06-24 to 2026-08-25 — two
 * months — and the only fact that survived each night was `drafted: 0`. A dead
 * model, an unparseable reply, a model that genuinely found no match, and a
 * dedup filter eating every draft all produce that same zero, and they call for
 * a repin, a prompt change, a rethink of the input, and a looser filter
 * respectively. Collapsing them made the next step unknowable.
 *
 * Same shape one layer up: a judge panel that cannot be reached fails closed,
 * which is correct, and looks identical to a panel that considered the
 * proposals and rejected them — which is not.
 *
 * Pure unit test: the model call is stubbed, no network, no DB.
 * Auto-discovered by scripts/test-unit.ts.
