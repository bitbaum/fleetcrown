/**
 * The retrieval planner, and the gate that closes the class it was built for.
 * Run: npx tsx scripts/test/loki-retrieval-plan.ts
 *
 * THE CLASS: a data source reachable only by TOOL CALL is invisible on every
 * turn where the tool loop cannot run — rate-limited, prompt too large, model
 * degraded. Production served that twice with the same symptom, and the
 * symptom is the nastiest kind: "Not in your data." is *true* of the facts the
 * model was handed, so it reads as a checked negative rather than as a failure.
 *
 *   2026-08-14 — the approval queue. Seven drafts waiting; Loki said nothing
 *                was pending.
 *   2026-09-11 — visitor feedback. Two reports filed minutes earlier, four
 *                runs spawned from them sitting in `waiting`; Loki said "Not in
 *                your data." about all of it, because no seed and no tool had
 *                ever read the feedback table at all.
 *
 * Each was fixed once, by hand, for one table. This file is the third fix: a
 * new tool whose data no seed can reach FAILS HERE, so the class cannot come
 * back a fourth time through a table nobody has thought of yet.
 *
 * Env-independent: the planner is pure, and the registry is read for metadata
 * only (names and kinds) — no handler is invoked, so no database is touched.
