# runtime-conformance-audit.sh — check the RUNNING system, not the source.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. bitbaum/fleet already has hosted-supabase-audit.sh, whose
# stated job is "does any repo still point at a Supabase we retired?". It ran on
# 2026-08-28 and reported SUCCESS while printcraft's production API returned 500,
# because it pointed at a hosted project whose DNS no longer resolved.
#
# It missed because it runs `git grep` over repo checkouts, and the reference
# lived in /opt/printcraft/shared/.env — not in git, deliberately, because the
# box is the environment SSOT. The gate was scoped to the wrong substrate: it
# checked the artifact while the configuration lived in the running system.
#
# So the rule this file implements: SOURCE audits run in CI against git;
# RUNTIME audits run here against what is actually deployed. The fleet had a
# good collection of the first kind and none of the second.
#
# Read-only. Prints one line per finding, exits 1 if any. Never prints a secret.
