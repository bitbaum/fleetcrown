# ── Why this file exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Fleet Runner ships an in-app updater (electron-updater, see
# desktop/src/main/index.ts). On a real box it silently could not finish the
# job, and the failure looked exactly like a working updater: the app checked,
# found 0.8.12, downloaded it, and posted "Fleet Runner v0.8.12 ready" — while
# staying on 0.8.11 for twelve days. Four independent reasons, each fatal:
#
#   1. The install was an EXTRACTED DIRECTORY (~/Applications/FleetRunner-0.8.11/).
#      electron-updater's detectInstallFormat() returns 'unknown' for that, and
#      on Linux it can only self-apply an AppImage. So it picked the .deb...
#   2. ...which needs `sudo dpkg -i`. Electron cannot escalate from userspace,
#      so the download parked in ~/.cache/fleet-runner-updater/pending/ forever.
#   3. The systemd unit hardcoded the VERSION IN THE PATH
#      (ExecStart=.../FleetRunner-0.8.11/fleet-runner). Even a perfect
#      self-update would have been overridden on the next boot — systemd would
#      have kept launching 0.8.11 out of the old directory.
#   4. The box cannot run an AppImage at all: AppImage type-2 needs libfuse2
#      (`libfuse.so.2`) and this machine has only libfuse3. So "just install the
#      AppImage and let electron-updater do its thing" is not available either —
#      the unit crash-loops with "AppImages require FUSE to run".
#
# Hence: download the AppImage, verify it, and EXTRACT it. Extraction needs no
# FUSE, so this works on every Linux box regardless of libfuse generation, and
# it produces exactly the layout the runner already ran from. The extracted
# tree goes in a versioned directory and a STABLE SYMLINK points at the current
# one, so the unit never names a version and an upgrade is one atomic rename.
#
# A systemd timer applies updates. It does not depend on the app being healthy,
# on a quit hook winning a race against SIGTERM, or on sudo — and every run
# lands in journald, so "did it update?" is a question with an answer.
#
# Deliberately no sudo anywhere: everything lives under $HOME and
# ~/.config/systemd/user. A background updater that needs a password is an
# updater that never runs.
