// Cron target — is any machine still running a Fleet Runner we replaced?
//
// WHY A CRON AND NOT JUST FLEET DOCTOR
// ------------------------------------
// The comparison also lives in Fleet Doctor, and on the hosted box Fleet Doctor
// runs NOTHING: `isRuntimeAvailable()` is false there, so the route returns a
// single "runs full checks only on the local install" warning and stops. A
// check that only exists in Doctor is therefore a check that never runs in
// production — verified by probing the live authenticated endpoint and getting
// back exactly one check named `runtime`. This clock is the live path.
//
// WHAT IT CATCHES
// ---------------
// Publishing a release is not a machine installing one, and FleetCrown had no
// way to tell the difference. On 2026-08-26 the laptop reported 0.8.12 while
// the box ran box-0.8.13. That runner predates the inject-hardening from
// 2026-08-23 (c350623c), so it kept acking unverified injects as `ok: true`
// instead of failing fast — 29 runs were reaped an hour later and billed to the
// projects whose prompts went unanswered, which climbed escalation ladders that
// could not clear.
//
// Zero tokens, no network, no new data: FLEET_RUNNER_RELEASES already says what
// shipped and every runner reports its version on every heartbeat.
//
// Four states, and the two boring-looking ones are load-bearing:
//   BEHIND  — alert. Merged desktop work is inert on that machine.
//   UNKNOWN — logged as a warning, never counted as a pass.
//   AHEAD   — fine. The box builds from main, so it reaches a version before
//             that version is tagged; alerting would fire on every merge and
//             train the operator to ignore this surface.
//   CURRENT — fine.
//
// Schedule: daily 06:50 UTC (scripts/install-hetzner-crons.sh), right after the
// telemetry freshness check.
