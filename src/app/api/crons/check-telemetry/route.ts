// Cron target — telemetry freshness detector.
//
// `claude_code_history` stopped receiving rows on 2026-06-10 and was still
// stopped 76 days later. Every check in the system passed the whole time: Fleet
// Doctor asserted the table EXISTS, the ingest swallowed its own errors by
// design (it must never block the operator), and /activity rendered fine — just
// missing 76 days of local agent work. Nothing was looking at whether the
// sensor still produced anything, so the outage had no symptom.
//
// This is the clock asking the one question that can tell: is there a RECENT ROW?
//
// Deliberately ZERO tokens and one cheap query per path — a monitor that cost
// AI budget would compete with the product for the resource it protects, and a
// monitor expensive enough to be worth disabling gets disabled.
//
// Four outcomes, never collapsed into two (see lib/telemetry-freshness.ts):
//   STALE     — worked, then stopped. The regression case. Alert.
//   SILENT    — never carried a row. Different fix. Alert.
//   UNCHECKED — the query failed. Logged as a warning, never counted as a pass.
//   FLOWING   — a row inside budget. Logged, so the checker's silence is
//               distinguishable from the checker never having run.
//
// Schedule: daily 06:45 UTC (scripts/install-hetzner-crons.sh), between the
// model-rot check and the 08:00 digest.
