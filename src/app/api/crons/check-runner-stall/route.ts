// Cron target — runner execution-stall detector, recoverer, and alerter.
//
// getRunnerExecutionStall already knows when commands are accepted but never
// executed (the runner's command loop is hung while its push heartbeat still
// says "Connected") — but it only ran when a human loaded /api/control, so a
// stalled fleet stayed silent until someone happened to look. This runs it on
// the clock and closes the loop three ways:
//   1. RECOVER  — reclaim claimed-but-unexecuted commands so a fresh runner
//                 poll re-runs them (idempotent; already safe to call anytime).
//   2. ALERT    — raise one in-app alert per stall (deduped until dismissed)
//                 and ping the operator on Telegram.
//   3. AUDIT    — log every tick to debug_logs as a heartbeat.
//
// Schedule: every 30 min (systemd timer, scripts/install-hetzner-crons.sh).
// Scoped to fleet-autopilot users (the population whose dispatches must land).
