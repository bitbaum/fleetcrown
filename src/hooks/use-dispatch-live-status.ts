/**
 * Poll a dispatch's live status so every surface that fires one — Loki's
 * transcript, the prompt library's "Send to terminal", the terminal's own
 * prompt composer — converges on the same recorded lifecycle (queued →
 * picked up → ran / failed) instead of freezing on the optimistic snapshot
 * from the moment the POST returned 200.
 *
 * Extracted from Transcript.tsx, where this was the only place a dispatch's
 * outcome was ever actually tracked after the click — every other fire-site
 * discarded the response body and showed a static "Sent" that looked
 * identical whether the work ran immediately or queued forever behind an
 * offline builder. SSOT so a fix here (a new terminal state, a longer poll
 * window) reaches every caller at once.
