/**
 * Global operating principles — the founder's cross-project engineering
 * standards, SEEDED from ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (the SSOT maintained there). These
 * apply to EVERY project and are injected as the Global tier of every dispatch's
 * context (composed with per-project context in getProjectContext), so the
 * autopilot builds to the same standards everywhere — not just stored, but
 * influencing every task.
 *
 * This is the code SSOT for the global tier. Editing here changes what every
 * agent on every project is held to. Keep in sync with ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.
 * (A per-user, in-product editable layer is the next step — it will override
 * this default once the prod DB/migration path is in place.)
