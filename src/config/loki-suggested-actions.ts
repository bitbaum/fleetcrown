 * The openers, and why they are worded this way.

 * Each names the surfaces it wants, because the retrieval planner reads the
 * words of the question to decide what to fetch. A starter that says "review
 * my fleet" plans projects; one that says "runs, feedback and approvals" plans
 * those too. The chip text is therefore load-bearing, not decoration — and it
 * is the reason the old "What needs me" could only ever answer about projects.
 *
 * Each also forbids the listing behaviour a modest model falls into when handed
 * an index: name a few things and say why, rather than reciting the fleet.
