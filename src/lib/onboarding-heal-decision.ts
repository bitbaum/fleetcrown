/**
 * Pure decision: given a user row, their active project count, and whether
 * the suggested username is available, returns the patch to apply (or null
 * if no heal needed). Extracted from healReturningUserOnboarding so the
 * branch logic is unit-testable without DB plumbing — see
 * scripts/test/onboarding-heal.ts.
 *
 * Lives in its own file (rather than inside onboarding-heal.ts) because the
 * test script must not pull in @/db at import time — that file initializes
 * the Postgres pool and fails without DATABASE_URL.
 *
 * Policy (updated 2026-06-05): heal fires for ANY user with a derivable,
 * unclaimed username — first-time sign-ins included. This bypasses the
 * /onboarding page entirely for the common GitHub-OAuth case (name + email
 * present → suggestion derives cleanly → mark onboarded). The username is
 * editable later from /settings → Profile, so we're not stealing the user's
 * choice — just defaulting it. Users whose suggestion collides or comes back
 * empty still fall through to the manual /onboarding flow.
 *
 * Project-count is now unused; kept in the signature for the heal wrapper's
 * convenience (it queries it anyway for other purposes) and to preserve the
 * test signature.
