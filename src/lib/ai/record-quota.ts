/**
 * Persist what a vendor just disclosed about its own remaining allowance.
 *
 * Called from the model seam on every response, success or refusal. Three
 * properties, each deliberate:
 *
 * NEVER AWAITED. The operator is waiting on an answer, and a telemetry write
 * has no business adding latency to it — still less failing it. The promise is
 * deliberately floated.
 *
 * NEVER THROWS. Every path is caught. A dashboard that cannot be written is a
 * dashboard that is out of date, which is survivable; an exception here would
 * turn a good answer into a link failure and demote a working vendor off the
 * chain, which is not.
 *
 * IMPORTS THE DATABASE LAZILY. `@/db` throws at MODULE INIT with no connection
 * string, so a static import would drag the whole unit suite into needing a
 * database to test a parser that touches none.

 * "called and empty" look identical on a dashboard and mean opposite things:
 * one vendor is healthy and unreachable, the other is exhausted. The first
 * version of the settings page reported Groq as "waiting to be measured" while
 * every single turn walked past it — four skips in six hours, at 8,312 and
 * 10,153 tokens against a 5,400 budget. That is not a wait, it is a permanent
 * exclusion with a cause the operator can act on.
 *
 * `remaining` is 0 only because the column is non-null; `source: "preflight"`

 * enforces it. On 2026-09-13 that gap put the capacity page in exactly the
 * position it was built to avoid: Groq drawn as healthy — 2,672 of 8,000 tokens
 * left this minute, 999 of 1,000 requests left today — while every call was
 * being refused, because a third counter the page could not see was at 227 of
 * 200,000 and the operator's questions were returning 503.
 *
 * Falls back to the plain refusal reading when the body names no numbers: that
 * still records the one fact any 429 carries, which is that this link is spent
 * right now. What it must never do is invent a figure — an invented outage is
 * the same failure as an invented allowance, and costs the operator a provider.
