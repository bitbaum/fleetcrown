/**
 * Wipe and re-seed the demo tenant.
 *
 * Called by scripts/seed-demo.ts (first install) and by the nightly cron in
 * src/app/api/crons/reset-demo/route.ts. Both go through here so "what the demo
 * contains" has one definition.
 *
 * ── Why the wipe is written this way ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * The obvious implementation is `DELETE FROM users WHERE email = demo` and let
 * ON DELETE CASCADE clean up. That does not work here: most of this schema
 * references users.id with no delete rule at all, so the delete either fails on
 * a foreign-key violation or, worse, succeeds against tables that DO cascade and
 * leaves the rest orphaned — rows owned by a user id that no longer exists.
 * This fleet has already shipped that bug once (73% of one table turned out to
 * be orphans).
 *
 * The second-obvious implementation is a hand-written list of deleteMany calls
 * in dependency order. That is what aoz-housing had, and it silently went stale
 * the moment someone added a table: the reset kept reporting success while
 * leaving rows behind.
 *
 * So the child tables are read from the LIVE FOREIGN-KEY CATALOG instead. Every
 * constraint that points at public.users is discovered at run time, which means
 * a table added next month is included without anyone remembering. Deletion runs
 * in repeated passes until a pass changes nothing, so no dependency order has to
 * be derived or maintained — rows blocked by another FK this pass simply go in
 * the next one.
 *
 * ── Why the guards are what they are ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * This function DELETES A USER AND EVERYTHING THEY OWN. On this instance the
 * neighbouring rows are George's real fleet. So it refuses unless the demo is
 * explicitly enabled, and it resolves its target by the demo email alone —
 * it never accepts a user id from a caller, because the one way this becomes a
 * catastrophe is a caller passing the wrong id.
