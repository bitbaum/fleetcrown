/**
 * AgentAdapter — the port that every agent CLI plugs into.
 *
 * Pre-2026-06-07 (v0.7.4) "agent" was data in src/lib/agent-registry.ts +
 * behavior scattered across `buildAgentOptionLaunchCommand`, `syncAgentSettings`,
 * and per-agent availability functions in the same file. Adding a new agent
 * (Cline, Aider, opencode, etc.) meant hunting through 5+ files and adding
 * branches to switch statements.
 *
 * The adapter pattern unifies all per-agent knowledge into ONE module per
 * agent. Adding a new agent is now: write `src/lib/agents/<name>.ts`,
 * import it in `index.ts`. No switch statements. No registry edits beyond
 * the one new line.
 *
 * Why this matters strategically: FleetCrown's value isn't owning the model
 * — it's owning the COORDINATION LAYER where any model plugs in. Linear,
 * Cursor, Vercel each lock you into one vendor; the adapter pattern is how
 * we stay vendor-neutral as agents proliferate.
 *
 * The interface is intentionally minimal. Anything that's the SAME across
 * agents (process detection, capability flags, model resolution from a
 * config file) is exposed via helpers in ./helpers.ts so each adapter can
 * pick what it needs without re-implementing.
