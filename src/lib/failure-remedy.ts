 *
 * SSOT note: the phrases here are the ones the runner composes its errors
 * FROM (desktop/src/main/poller.ts). scripts/test/failure-message-pairing.ts
 * reads the runner's throws and asserts each one is recognised, so a reworded
 * message on either side fails a test instead of drawing the wrong button.
