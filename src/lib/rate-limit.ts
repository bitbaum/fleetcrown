 * Rate limiting — now owned by `limitkit` (see dotfiles/SHARED.md).
 *
 * This file keeps the call signatures its eight callers were written against,
 * so adopting the package changed no route. What DID change, silently for the
 * better: the old implementation kept a bare Map keyed by client IP with no
 * eviction — every stranger who ever hit an endpoint left an entry until the
 * process restarted. limitkit's MemoryStore is bounded (LRU past 5 000 keys),
 * so that slow leak is impossible by construction.
 *
 * Keep this a shim. A local re-implementation "just for one tweak" is how the
 * shared version becomes the stale version — the fix that lands upstream then
 * silently never reaches here.
