/**
 * Is the machine actually running the Fleet Runner we published?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * FleetCrown publishes desktop releases and had no idea whether any machine
 * ever installed one. Both halves of that sentence were load-bearing on
 * 2026-08-26:
 *
 *   * releases had not been cut at all for 12 days (nobody minted the tag —
 *     fixed in #370/#374), and
 *   * the laptop was still running 0.8.12 while the box ran box-0.8.13.
 *
 * The consequence was not cosmetic. 0.8.12 predates the inject-hardening that
 * landed 2026-08-23 (`c350623c`), so that runner acked an unverified inject as
 * `ok: true` and left the run to be reaped an hour later instead of failing
 * fast. 29 runs died that way and were billed to the projects whose prompts
 * went unanswered. A machine quietly running old code produced degraded
 * behaviour for twelve days and nothing anywhere said so.
 *
 * The comparison needs no network and no new data: `FLEET_RUNNER_RELEASES` is
 * already the SSOT for what has shipped, and every runner already reports its
 * version on every heartbeat. Nothing was missing except the subtraction.
