/**
 * Boot-time environment sanity check.
 *
 * The recurring failure mode in this app is SILENT config rot: a secret goes
 * missing or picks up a trailing "\n" (which once broke ALL email + the
 * private-zone PIN), or one half of a provider's key pair is set so the
 * provider quietly disappears (how the X OAuth saga started). None of these
 * crash anything — they just make auth/email stop working, discovered days
 * later by a user. This module converts that class of failure into a loud,
 * immediate signal: logged at boot (see instrumentation.ts) and surfaced in
 * /api/health so the post-deploy assertion can fail the deploy.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT throw / refuse to boot — a crash-loop is its own
 * outage and is harder to diagnose remotely. The signal is "health says
 * degraded + debug_logs says why", which the deploy gate turns red on.
