 * It lived in github-evidence.ts, which fetches from the GitHub API and pulls
 * in Next's fetch extensions. The moment control-types imported the TYPE from
 * there, the desktop package's typecheck started walking that chain and broke
 * on `next: { revalidate }`, which does not exist in its DOM lib. A shape that
 * both a client type and a server fetcher need belongs below both of them.
