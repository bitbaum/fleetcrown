/**
 * Run progress — the one signal that says "the agent is still working".
 *
 * A dispatch produced exactly three run events for a whole day of work:
 * dispatched, submitted, closed. Between "submitted" and "closed" — typically
 * 20–60 minutes — nothing was written anywhere, so every surface that read the
 * run (Feedback, Control) had to guess, and guessed "Queued", then "Not
 * running", while the agent was in fact busy. The runner owns the agent's PTY
 * and sees every byte it prints; that is the source of truth, and this module
 * is the contract between the runner that reports it and the surfaces that
 * read it.
 *
 * The runner beats at most once per RUN_PROGRESS_BEAT_MS, and only when the
 * PTY printed something since the last beat — a silent agent produces no
 * beats, so "no progress for RUN_PROGRESS_FRESH_MS" honestly means stalled.
