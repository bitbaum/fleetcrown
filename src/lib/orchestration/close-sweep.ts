/**
 * Unattended run-close sweep — close open runs from runner-PUSHED session state.
 *
 * The only run-closer used to be the /api/control GET: it reads the freshest
 * session handoff and closes the run — but it only executes when a human loads
 * the page. Unattended (autopilot at 04:00, founder asleep), a box agent would
 * finish its task, push its handoff, and the run still sat open until the
 * reaper stamped it. This sweep runs on the clock (reap-stale-runs cron, BEFORE
 * reaping): for every open run, project the persisted project_states row into a
 * SessionState and put it through the exact same seam close + DoD gate the page
 * path uses. Same inputs, same gate, same ledger — just no human required.
 *
 * node-only (the claude seam pulls in fs) — import from route handlers only.
