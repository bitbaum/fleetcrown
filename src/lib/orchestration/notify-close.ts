/**
 * Tell the operator their dispatch finished.
 *
 * A dispatch is an asynchronous job a human started and then walked away from —
 * that is the whole point of having an always-on builder. Clicking Send and
 * receiving nothing back is the failure users describe as "I don't know if it
 * worked": the run completed, the result exists, and the only way to learn that
 * was to still be staring at the tab.
 *
 * Every CONFIGURED channel is used, not the first one that happens to exist.
 * This shipped Telegram-only and returned early when TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID was
 * unset — which it is in production — so the notification silently went
 * nowhere even for runs that had opted in. Web push is the channel that
 * reaches the installed PWA on the operator's phone, which is exactly where
 * someone who dispatched and pocketed the device is looking.
 *
 * Runs still opt in via payload.notifyOnClose, so autopilot churn stays silent;
 * see markHumanInitiated for who sets it.
 *
 * Fire-and-forget by contract: called as `void notifyRunClosed(...)` from the
 * close choke points, must never throw or slow a close. The message logic lives
 * in notify-close-format.ts (pure, unit-tested).
