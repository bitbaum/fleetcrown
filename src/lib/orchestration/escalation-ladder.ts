/**
 * Escalation ladder — retry → patch → replan → human. Pure logic (no db).
 *
 * The ladder converts consecutive failing closes into STRUCTURE instead of
 * vibes: each failing run advances the project's open escalation one rung,
 * and the rung shapes the NEXT already-scheduled autopilot dispatch (the
 * objection is fed back to the agent first — humans see only what agents
 * can't route around). The ladder never dispatches anything by itself:
 * uncapped auto-retry is how fleets burn money, so cadence stays owned by
 * the existing autopilot loop and its cooldowns.
 *
 * The top rung is the failure brake: FAILURE_BRAKE_STREAK in
 * dispatch-gates.ts imports ESCALATION_HUMAN_STREAK so "autopilot stops"
 * and "a human is alerted" are the same rung by construction and can never
 * drift apart.

/**
 * What one closed run does to the project's ladder.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS — the one-way door
 * ----------------------------------
 * The ladder used to ADVANCE on `isFailingOutcome(outcome)` but RESOLVE only on
 * `outcome === "success"`. Two locally sensible rules — "incomplete work is not
 * a failure" and "don't declare victory early" — composed into a state with no
 * exit: `partial` could neither climb the ladder nor clear it, and `partial` is
 * the most common outcome there is (52 of 117 closes measured 2026-08-26).
 *
 * So ladders stayed open indefinitely. Seventeen were open at once, none of
 * them with a single `success` since opening: surf-your-life sat at the top
 * rung for 13 days while completing 7 runs' worth of real work, and orangecat's
 * open rungs kept injecting "your previous run FAILED" into dispatch prompts
 * for a project that was working.
 *
 * The failure brake never had this bug: `leadingFailureStreak` stops at the
 * first non-failing outcome, so a `partial` resets it. orchestration-runs.ts
 * even claimed the two agreed — "isFailingOutcome is the same predicate the
 * failure brake uses, so ladder rungs and brake streak count the same events"
 * — which was true for advancing and false for resetting. That divergence IS
 * the bug.
 *
 * Hence one function, used by every close path, symmetric by construction:
 * whatever does not count as a failure resets the failure streak.
