/**
 * What of a user row may reach that user's own browser.
 *
 * `GET /api/me` returned the Drizzle row verbatim, so every authenticated page
 * load handed the client `passwordHash` and `privateZonePinHash`. Both are the
 * user's own — this is not a cross-account leak — but a credential digest in a
 * page response is reachable by anything the page is reachable by: an extension,
 * an XSS, a logging proxy, a screenshot of devtools. The PIN hash is the sharper
 * end: it guards the private zone and protects a short numeric secret, so an
 * offline attempt against it is cheap in a way a password hash is not.
 *
 * The list is an ALLOW-list, and both halves are exhaustive over the schema —
 * `scripts/test/user-client-view.ts` fails until every column in `users` is
 * named as exposed or withheld. A deny-list would be blind to the column added
 * tomorrow, which is the one that ships.
 *
 * "Exposed" means *reviewed and judged safe for the owner's own browser* — not
 * "must be sent". Narrowing it further is a change to this file only.
