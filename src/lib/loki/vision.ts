/**
 * Vision preflight for Loki image attachments — turns screenshots into
 * actionable text the chat brain and terminal agents can use.
 *
 * Model choice is a CHAIN, not a pin (config/vision-models.ts). The previous
 * hardcoded Groq model was decommissioned and every attached image 404'd; a
 * single pinned free model is a scheduled outage, so the provider chain and the
 * `probe:models` check exist to make the next rot loud instead of silent.
