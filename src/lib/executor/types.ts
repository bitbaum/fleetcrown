/**
 * The Executor abstraction — the SSOT for "run an agent, write to it, read it,
 * observe it." See docs/architecture/agent-execution-platform.md.
 *
 * Terminal-agnostic BY CONSTRUCTION: it traffics in a stable id, raw PTY bytes,
 * and structured events — never a zellij session/tab name. The same interface is
 * satisfied by LocalPtyExecutor (dev/self-host, here) and later SandboxExecutor
 * (Firecracker/gVisor/K8s/Fly/e2b, multi-tenant production) with zero changes to
 * the control plane or the UI. The interface is intentionally minimal — it is
 * defined BY its first real implementation (LocalPty) rather than guessed, and
 * grows only as a concrete executor needs it (snapshot/restore arrive with the
 * SandboxExecutor that can actually hibernate).
