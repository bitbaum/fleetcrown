/**
 * provisionAgentWorkspace — the SSOT for "launch an agent in a FleetCrown-owned
 * PTY." Used by both /api/workspaces (the browser terminal) and /api/agent/launch
 * (Control's launch button on a self-hosted box). Builds the SAME login-interactive
 * shell + registry launch command the legacy zellij path used, so PATH/env/model
 * resolution is identical — only the substrate (an owned PTY vs a zellij pane) differs.
 *
 * Why this replaces zellij name-puppeting on the server: a zellij `action
 * go-to-tab-name` blocks forever on a detached session (a headless box has no
 * attached client), so launch timed out. Owning the PTY removes the dependency
 * on an attached human terminal entirely.
