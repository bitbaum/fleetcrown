/**
 * Where a dispatched project actually lives on THIS runner — the one decision,
 * in one place.
 *
 * A dispatch carries the founder's LAPTOP path (`/home/g/dev/solon`). On the
 * laptop that path exists and is used as-is; on the always-on box it does not,
 * and the work happens in a box-local clone (`~/dev/solon`).
 *
 * `ensureBoxWorkspace` has always made that call, but it made it *privately*:
 * the resolved directory never escaped `launchAgentPty`, so every other part of
 * the runner that needed to know where the agent actually ran kept using the
 * unresolved laptop path. Two things silently broke as a result — both of them
 * lookups into `~/.claude/projects/<slug-of-dir>`, which on the box resolved to
 * a `-home-g-dev-*` slug that cannot exist there:
 *
 *   - Token accounting (#133/#145) tracked runs at the laptop path, found no
 *     transcript, and skipped forever. It wrote ZERO rows in its first day live.
 *   - `detectAuthFailure` read the same non-existent directory, so dead box
 *     credentials were undetectable — the exact failure its own comment warns
 *     about.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free (fs/os/path only) so the poller can import it
 * statically without dragging `@/db` into the desktop bundle — the reason
 * `box-workspace.ts` is dynamically imported in the first place.
