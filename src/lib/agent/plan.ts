/**
 * The retrieval planner — which sources a turn reads, and in what order.
 *
 * Pure: a message in, a plan out. No database, no model. This is the decision
 * that used to be made by the model inside the tool loop ("which tool do I
 * call?"), and it moved here for one reason: the loop needs a healthy model
 * AND a prompt that fits a per-minute window before it can ask a single
 * question, and in production it had neither — every turn shipped zero facts
 * and the model was asked to reason about an empty page. A keyword planner is
 * dumber than a model and it is never rate-limited. It answers the cheap
 * question ("is this about feedback?") so the model can spend its one call on
 * the expensive one ("what does this feedback mean for the operator?").
 *
 * Cat (OrangeCat's assistant, which the operator considers good) works this
 * way: fifteen sources fetched in parallel before the model is called, tools
 * only as enrichment behind a keyword pre-filter. Loki now does the same.
 *
 * Ordering is the second half of the job. The fact set is head-sliced when it
 * has to shrink, so the FIRST source in the plan is the one the operator asked
 * about, and the always-on background (projects, the fleet pulse) comes last.
