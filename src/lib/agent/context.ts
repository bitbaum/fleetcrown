/**
 * Loki's grounded context assembly — the seed every turn starts from.
 *
 * One builder, used by BOTH paths: the in-app tool loop (primary) and the
 * gateway fallback. Until 2026-09-11 there were two seeds. The loop's seed was
 * people + projects and nothing else; the richer one here — approvals, the
 * knowledge index, the economy feed, the cue-gated brief — was built only on
 * the fallback path, which normal turns never reached. So the approval queue
 * was "seeded so it survives losing the tool loop" (#262) on a path the tool
 * loop never took, and the primary path could see the queue only by calling a
 * tool it could not afford to call. One seed, one definition, both paths.
 *
 * What goes in is decided by the retrieval planner (plan.ts): the sources the
 * question is about, fetched in parallel, leading subject first. Facts are
 * typed records with declared fields and `<not recorded>` for gaps; computed
 * answers (the daily and fleet briefs) ride alongside as directives the model
 * may only phrase.
 *
 * Best-effort throughout: a source that throws contributes nothing rather
 * than failing the turn, and the contract adapts — fewer facts permit fewer
 * citations, and none instructs a refusal.
