/**
 * The grounding contract, plus the clause it was missing: you are allowed to
 * think.
 *
 * ── The bug this exists to end ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Asked "what do you think about heidi", Loki replied:
 *
 *     An opinion or assessment is: Not in your data.
 *
 * …and then listed every record whose text contained "Heidi", including two
 * unrelated people who happen to be named Heidi.
 *
 * It was obeying the contract exactly. `buildContract` says (1) every claim
 * about the operator MUST cite a record id, and (3) if any part of the request
 * has no supporting record, answer that part with exactly "Not in your data."
 * An opinion is not a record. So the model looked one up, failed to find it,
 * and refused — a category error the contract made mandatory.
 *
 * ── Why the shared package is not wrong, only incomplete ─────────────────────
 * ai-kit's OTHER contract builder, `buildAssistantRules` (the prose variant
 * Cat uses), already carries the equivalent carve-out as its rule 5: general
 * knowledge "is fine to use and is not covered by rules 1–2. The restriction is
 * on facts about THIS user." The typed-record builder never grew one. So the
 * WEAKER contract is the usable one and the stronger contract forbids
 * reasoning — an asymmetry inside one file.
 *
 * The durable fix belongs upstream in `buildContract`. It is amended here
 * because ai-kit is a shared package with another consumer (OrangeCat) and an
 * active branch, and FleetCrown's chat is broken now. When the rule lands
 * upstream, delete this file and call `buildGroundedContext` directly.
 *
 * ── Why appending is safe ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The clause is inserted at the END of the contract section rather than after
 * the records, because the contract opens with "this overrides every formatting
 * instruction below" — a narrowing placed below that line would be outranked by
 * the thing it is narrowing.

  `7. "${"Not in your data."}" is about missing FACTS. It is never the answer to a request for JUDGMENT. If the operator asks what you think, for an assessment, a comparison, a recommendation, a risk, or a "should I" — produce one.
