/**
 * Fact adapters for the operator's own work: goals, habits, commitments and
 * deadlines, the crew and what they hold, sticky-note captures.
 *
 * These used to be built inline in the tool handlers, which meant they existed
 * ONLY behind a tool call — a question about goals asked on a turn where the
 * tool loop could not run (rate-limited, or the prompt too big to fit a single
 * call) was answered from a context that had never heard of goals. One adapter
 * per domain, called by BOTH the seed builder and the tool handler, is the
 * shape that survived for approvals (#262) and is now the rule for everything.
 *
 * Same contract as sources.ts: a Fact carries only STORED values; a field the
 * table has no value for stays null and renders as `<not recorded>`.
