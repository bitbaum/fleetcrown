/**
 * Turn cues — pure predicates deciding which context a turn earns.
 *
 * Kept apart from the data layer so the policy can be tested without a
 * database. Every cue is matched loosely on purpose, because the two errors
 * are not symmetric: a false positive costs a few hundred tokens of records
 * the model ignores; a false negative costs a confident wrong answer about the
 * operator's own data. Production served the false negative on 2026-08-14
 * (approvals) and again on 2026-09-11 (feedback), and both times the answer
 * — "Not in your data." — was indistinguishable from a checked one.
 *
 * Several independent words per cue rather than one canonical term, so the
 * question survives any single one being missing or misspelled ("what is
 * pening for approval" is a real transcript line).
