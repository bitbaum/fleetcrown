/**
 * Type into the session without fighting the terminal for focus.
 *
 * The old phone flow was "tap the black rectangle, hope the keyboard opens,
 * type into a canvas". Every part of that is fragile on a phone: xterm's hidden
 * textarea is a 1×1 element the browser is reluctant to focus, autocorrect
 * rewrites shell words mid-command, and the IME's composition buffer sends
 * partial UTF-8 to a PTY that expects finished bytes. The status line even said
 * "LIVE · TAP TO TYPE", which was a request, not a feature.
 *
 * A real `<textarea>` fixes all of it at once: the browser focuses it, the
 * operator can see and edit what they are about to send, autocorrect can be
 * turned off properly, and the whole line lands in the PTY as one write.
 *
 * Send appends a carriage return by default — the overwhelmingly common intent
 * is "run this". The ⏎ toggle turns that off for the case that genuinely needs
 * it: typing into a TUI's own filter or search field, where submitting early
 * picks the wrong item. It is a visible two-state chip rather than a hidden
 * gesture, because a thing that changes what your keystrokes mean has to be
 * readable at a glance.
