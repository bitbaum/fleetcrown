/**
 * Persistent "you are in the demo" strip.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT dismissible, unlike the email reminder next to it. Two
 * reasons, and the second is the real one:
 *
 *   • The demo resets nightly. A visitor who forgets they are in a demo and
 *     starts organising real work loses it, which is a worse experience than a
 *     strip they cannot close.
 *   • Some controls are inert here — dispatch, terminals, outbound. Without a
 *     standing explanation, a disabled button reads as a broken product rather
 *     than a boundary, and the demo would argue AGAINST the thing it exists to
 *     sell.
