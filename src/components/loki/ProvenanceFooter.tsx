/**
 * What produced this answer, under the answer.
 *
 * Two jobs, and the second is the important one.
 *
 * 1. Say which model answered, what was read, which tools ran, how long it
 *    took. An operator who can see "read feedback 5, runs 7" knows instantly
 *    whether a thin answer is a thin database or a thin retrieval — and
 *    before this, the only way to find out was to read the server journal.
 *
 * 2. Mark an answer that FAILED verification. The grounding harness has always
 *    computed this and the API has always returned it; the /loki route dropped
 *    it on persist and the floating assistant never read it, so a turn whose
 *    unsupported claims survived the repair pass rendered exactly like a clean
 *    one. That is the precise failure the harness exists to prevent — "being
 *    wrong looked exactly like being right" — reintroduced at the last inch.
 *    The warning is loud on purpose.
