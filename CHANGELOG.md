# Changelog

Notable, user-facing changes. Older history lives in the git log (conventional commits).

## 2026-06-27 (b)

### Changed
- **Theme control.** Light / Dark / Auto is now a single cycle button in the top bar,
  sidebar footer, and mobile menu — not three separate buttons. Settings uses one
  dropdown.
- **Mobile navigation.** Bottom bar is Today · Control · Loki · Menu; the Menu sheet
  lists routes by sidebar section (Work / Private / Site) with appearance, settings,
  and sign-out in the footer.

### Added
- **Responsive design SSOT.** `docs/development/responsive-design.md` documents mobile
  chrome tokens, shell layout, component patterns, audit commands, and a viewport
  testing checklist.

### Changed
- **Mobile shell and viewport math.** Layer 1 tokens (`--app-topbar-height`,
  `--app-viewport-height`) plus `.app-viewport-pane` / `.app-page-compact` replace
  ad-hoc `100vh` heights on Loki, Terminal, and workspace routes.
- **Control project rail on phones.** Vertical project list instead of a hidden
  horizontal scroll strip.
- **Public marketing surfaces.** Hero fold, lede typography, nav padding, and signed-out
  CTA tuned for narrow viewports.

### Fixed
- **Mobile usability across the app.** Loki composer stacks on phones (no horizontal
  overflow); modals respect bottom-nav inset; drawers scroll with safe-area padding;
  Terminal "My machine" tabs stack above the xterm pane; Habits/People/Projects detail
  layouts wrap on narrow screens; horizontal page scroll contained at the shell.

### Added
- **Fleet-knowledge RAG (pgvector).** Captain-layer retrieval-augmented context: a
  `knowledge_embeddings` vector index over project profiles + dev-logs (never repo
  code — the runtime retrieves that itself). Dispatches now carry a "Relevant context
  from your other projects" block, retrieved against the task. Local embeddings via a
  fastembed server on the box (BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5, 384-dim, no cloud key); daily
  reindex. Engine under cross-project reference; first real fix for the
  "memory is the weakest strut" gap. Docs: `docs/architecture/fleet-knowledge-rag.md`.
- **Hosted runner via Hermes.** When the local Fleet Runner is offline, a work dispatch
  is auto-routed to a hosted runner that orchestrates Nous Research's **Hermes** (Nous
  Portal, `qwen3-coder-next`) in a sandbox, makes the change, and **opens a PR** — instead
  of the command waiting forever. systemd timer + dedicated runner deployment on the box.
- **Settings → Voice.** A per-user writing-voice preference, injected into Loki's replies
  (both the gateway agent and the Groq fallback) and drafted content. Backed by a
  `thoughts-style-guide.md` house-voice SSOT.
- **Cross-product specs.** `docs/architecture/cross-project-reference.md` (1 target · N
  references) and the RAG design.

### Changed
- **Public hero shows the real fleet.** The landing console now renders the owner's
  *actual* fleet (real project names, real one-line descriptions, real counts, live
  running status) instead of fabricated data — and only says "LIVE" when an agent is
  actually running. No invented metrics ship.
- **Public profile (`/u/…`) reskinned** onto the always-dark `PublicSurface` (it was the
  lone public page rendering light), with a flagship hierarchy, real descriptions, and a
  "Fleet activity" section (recent agent runs) — liveness a repo list can't show.
- **Project descriptions backfilled** from real sources; the "Local repository imported
  from fleetcrown-ui" placeholder is suppressed everywhere (profile, hero, RAG).

### Fixed
- **Real-name leak.** Loki addressed the operator by their real name (the shared OpenClaw
  agent's persona/memory held it). Scrubbed across the agent's `USER.md`/`SOUL.md`/memory +
  the FleetCrown source; Loki now uses the pseudonym. The internal routing slug is
  unchanged (cross-surface session continuity preserved).
- **Orphaned-session / stale identity** healing in the auth JWT callback (earlier in the series).
